**Color Detection**

**Description:**
Color Detection is a simple Python script that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and identify dominant colors in an image. The script uses the OpenCV library for image processing and color analysis. It allows users to input an image file and receive a visual representation of the most prominent colors present in the image.

**Features:**
- Detects dominant colors in an image.
- Provides a graphical representation of the identified colors.
- Easy-to-use and user-friendly interface.
- OpenCV-based image processing for accurate color analysis.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository or download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/hemanth5544/colordetection).
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `color_detection.py` script.
4. Provide the path to the image file you want to analyze when prompted.
5. The script will process the image and display the detected colors along with their percentage of dominance.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

**Example:**
```bash
$ python color_detection.py
Enter the path to the image: /path/to/your/image.jpg
```
